Happy New Year, **San Jose** families! Welcome to 2026!

The confetti has settled. The last guest has gone home. And now, reality sets in. After two weeks of late nights, extra cookies, and zero schedules, the thought of getting back to the "school routine" can feel terrifying.

I call it the "Toddler Jet Lag." Even though you didn't fly across time zones, your child's body clock is likely on "Party Time."

Don't panic. You don't need to fix everything in one day. Here is my "Soft Landing" strategy to ease your family back into reality before school starts.

### 1. The "15-Minute" Slide
If your toddler has been going to sleep at 9:30 PM (instead of 7:30 PM), forcing them to bed early tonight will only result in a battle.
**The Strategy:** Shift bedtime earlier by just 15 minutes each night.
*   Tonight: 9:15 PM
*   Tomorrow: 9:00 PM
*   The next day: 8:45 PM
It’s a gentle slide, not a cliff. Their bodies will adjust much faster without the tears.

### 2. Reintroduce "Boring" Food
Let's be honest, we've all been eating a lot of rich food. Toddlers get used to the constant stream of treats very quickly.
**The Strategy:** Don't make a big speech about "no more sugar." Just quietly change the menu.
Serve simple, familiar comfort foods. Oatmeal for breakfast. Rice and veggies for dinner. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Their little bodies need a detox just as much as ours do.

### 3. Talk Up the "School Wins"
Separation anxiety might flare up after being home with you for so long. This is normal!
**The Strategy:** Start talking about school *now*, but focus on the specific things they love.
Instead of "You have to go to school," try:
*"I wonder if the tricycles are still on the playground?"*
*"I bet Teacher Sarah missed you so much."*
*"Do you think the goldfish grew bigger while we were gone?"*
Spark their curiosity. Remind them that school is a place of fun, not just a place away from you.

### A Fresh Start
2026 is a blank page. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to show up.
We are so excited to welcome all our students back to Sunny Child Care. We've missed their smiles, their stories, and yes, even their chaos.

Here's to a wonderful year ahead!

**San Jose** 的家庭們，新年快樂！歡迎來到 2026 年！

彩帶碎屑都掃乾淨了。最後一位客人也回家了。現在，現實來了。經過兩週的熬夜、吃不完的餅乾和毫無章法的作息，想到要回歸「上學模式」簡直讓人瑟瑟發抖。

我稱之為「幼兒時差 (Toddler Jet Lag)」。即使你們沒有飛越時區，你孩子的生理時鐘很可能還停留在「派對時間」。

別慌。你不需要在一天內搞定所有事。這是我的「軟著陸」策略，幫你的家庭在開學前慢慢找回現實感。

### 1. 「15 分鐘」滑行法
如果你家幼兒最近都混到晚上 9:30 才睡（而不是平常的 7:30），今晚強迫他們早睡只會引發一場戰爭。
**策略：** 每天晚上將睡覺時間提早 15 分鐘。
*   今晚：9:15 PM
*   明天：9:00 PM
*   後天：8:45 PM
這是一個溫柔的滑梯，而不是懸崖。他們的身體會適應得更快，而且不會有眼淚。

### 2. 讓食物變「無聊」
老實說，我們大家都吃了很多大魚大肉。幼兒很快就會習慣那種源源不絕的零食供應。
**策略：** 不需要發表「以後不准吃糖」的演講。只要安靜地改變菜單就好。
提供簡單、熟悉的舒適食物。早餐吃燕麥粥。晚餐吃白飯配青菜。多喝水、多喝水、多喝水。他們小小的身體跟我們一樣需要排毒。

### 3. 聊聊學校的「好事」
在跟你黏在一起這麼久之後，分離焦慮可能會再次爆發。這很正常！
**策略：** *現在*就開始聊學校，但專注在他們喜歡的具體事物上。
與其說「你要去上學了」，試試看：
*「不知道三輪車是不是還在操場上？」*
*「Teacher Sarah 一定很想你。」*
*「你覺得我們不在的時候，魚缸裡的金魚有沒有長大？」*
激發他們的好奇心。提醒他們學校是一個充滿樂趣的地方，而不只是一個離開你的地方。

### 全新的開始
2026 年是一張白紙。你不需要很完美。你只需要「在場」。
我們非常興奮能歡迎所有學生回到 Sunny Child Care。我們想念他們的笑容、他們的故事，是的，甚至想念他們的混亂。

祝大家有個美好的一年！
