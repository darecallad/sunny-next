## The "Snotty Nose" Season

Is it just me, or does it seem like *everyone* is coughing right now? Here in **San Jose**, we are lucky that our winters are mild, but that doesn't stop the flu season from hitting hard.

As a Director, I see it every year. One child gets a sniffle, and suddenly half the class is out. Parents often ask me with a desperate look: *"Jessie, how do I stop him from getting sick every two weeks?"*

The truth is, toddlers are germ magnets. Their immune systems are still learning. But at **Sunny Child Care**, we have strict protocols to keep our center healthy, and there are things you can do at home to build that "immunity shield."

### 1. The "Happy Birthday" Hand Wash

We all know hand washing is the #1 defense. But have you ever watched a toddler wash their hands? It usually involves splashing water for 2 seconds and touching the soap without using it.

We make it a game. We sing the "Happy Birthday" song (twice!) while scrubbing.

> **Director Jessie's Tip:** Buy "foaming" soap. Toddlers love the texture, and it makes it easier to see if they have actually covered their hands. If they wash their hands as soon as they come home from the park or grocery store, you cut the risk significantly.

### 2. Hydration, Hydration, Hydration

In the summer, we remember to drink water. But in winter, we often forget. Dry air (from heaters) dries out nasal passages, making it easier for viruses to enter.

At school, we encourage frequent water breaks.

> **Try this:** If your child refuses cold water in winter, try warm water with a slice of lemon, or warm herbal tea (decaf). We serve warm soups at lunch here at Sunny, which is a great way to sneak in fluids and veggies at the same time.

### 3. Get Outside (Yes, Even if it's Chilly)

There is a myth that cold air makes you sick. It doesn't! Germs make you sick. Being stuck indoors with poor ventilation is actually worse.

**San Jose** winters are beautiful. Put on a jacket and go for a walk. Fresh air helps clear the lungs and the Vitamin D from the sun boosts the immune system.

### Health is a Team Sport

We take health seriously at **Sunny Child Care**. From our commercial-grade air purifiers to our "sick policy," we work hard to keep our community safe.

If you are looking for a childcare center that prioritizes your child's well-being as much as their education, we’d love to meet you.

## 「掛著兩條鼻涕」的季節

是不是覺得最近身邊的人都在咳嗽？雖然我們 **San Jose** 的冬天很溫暖，但流感季可沒在客氣的。

身為園長，我每年都看著同樣的戲碼上演。一個孩子開始吸鼻子，沒過幾天，半個班級都請假了。家長常帶著絕望的眼神問我：「Jessie，到底要怎麼做才能讓他不要每兩個禮拜就生病一次？」

說實話，幼兒就是「細菌磁鐵」。他們的免疫系統還在學習辨識病毒。但在 **Sunny Child Care**，我們有嚴格的衛生規範來保護大家，而你在家裡也可以做這三件事，幫孩子建立「免疫防護罩」。

### 1. 「生日快樂」洗手歌

我們都知道洗手是第一道防線。但你有看過幼兒洗手嗎？通常是玩水兩秒鐘，摸一下肥皂（甚至沒搓出泡泡）就結束了。

我們把它變成一個遊戲。我們會一邊搓手，一邊唱「生日快樂歌」（要唱兩遍才夠久！）。

> **Jessie 園長的小撇步：** 買「慕斯狀」的洗手乳。幼兒超愛那種綿密的泡泡手感，而且這樣你也比較容易看出來他們是不是真的把肥皂塗滿了雙手。只要養成「一回家就洗手」的習慣，生病機率真的會降低很多。

### 2. 補水，補水，再補水

夏天我們都會記得喝水，但冬天常會忘記。暖氣會讓空氣變乾，導致鼻腔黏膜乾燥，這樣病毒更容易入侵。

在學校，我們非常鼓勵孩子多喝水。

> **試試這樣做：** 如果孩子冬天不愛喝冷水，試試溫水加一片檸檬，或是溫熱的無咖啡因花草茶。在 Sunny，我們午餐會提供熱湯，這也是同時補充水分和蔬菜營養的絕佳方法。

### 3. 去戶外走走（是的，就算有點冷）

有一個迷思是「吹冷風會感冒」。其實不會！是病毒讓你感冒。一直待在通風不良的室內，反而更容易交叉感染。

**San Jose** 的冬天其實很舒服。穿上外套，帶孩子去散步吧。新鮮空氣能幫助肺部循環，陽光中的維生素 D 更是增強免疫力的好幫手。

### 健康是團隊合作

在 **Sunny Child Care**，我們非常重視健康。從醫療級的空氣清淨機到嚴格的生病隔離政策，我們努力保護這個社群的安全。
