The holidays are about connection. But for a toddler, a room full of loud relatives looming over them asking for hugs and kisses can be terrifying.

We've all been there. Uncle Bob leans in for a big bear hug, and your toddler hides behind your leg. You feel the pressure to say, *"Don't be rude! Give Uncle Bob a hug."*

Stop right there.

At Sunny Child Care, we teach a very important lesson: **"My Body, My Choice."** Forcing a child to show physical affection teaches them that they have to please adults even when they are uncomfortable. That is not a lesson we want them to carry into adulthood.

Here is how to handle these awkward holiday moments with grace and firm boundaries.

### 1. Offer "Greeting Options"
Before you arrive at the party in **San Jose** or **Fremont**, practice different ways to say hello.
"We are going to see Grandma. You can give her a hug, a high-five, a fist bump, or just wave. You choose!"

When the moment comes, prompt them: *"Uncle Bob is here! Do you want to give a high-five or a wave?"*
This empowers the child. They are still being polite (acknowledging the person), but they are in control of their physical space.

### 2. Be the "Bodyguard"
Your relatives might not understand modern gentle parenting. They might take it personally. That's okay. It is your job to run interference.

If a relative swoops in and your child pulls away, step in immediately. Keep your tone light and breezy:
*"Oh, looks like he's in a waving mood today! High-five, Auntie!"*
You deflect the awkwardness and validate your child's feeling without making the relative feel attacked.

### 3. Don't Apologize for Their Boundaries
It is tempting to say, *"Sorry, he's just shy."*
But "shy" implies a deficit. Instead, try: *"He's just listening to his body right now."* or *"We're practicing asking before we hug."*

When you respect their "no" today, you are teaching them that their "no" matters. You are teaching them that they have the right to set boundaries with their own body—a skill that will keep them safe for the rest of their lives.

### A Gift of Confidence
The best gift you can give your child this holiday isn't a toy; it's the confidence to know that their voice matters.

節日是關於連結的時刻。但對一個幼兒來說，一屋子的大人彎著腰向他們索求擁抱和親吻，可能是一件很可怕的事。

我們都經歷過這種場面。Bob 叔叔張開雙臂要來個大大的擁抱，而你的孩子躲在你的腿後面。你感到一股壓力，忍不住想說：*「不要沒禮貌！去抱一下叔叔。」*

請停下來。

在 Sunny Child Care，我們教導一個非常重要的觀念：**「我的身體，我作主。」** 強迫孩子表現出肢體上的親密，會讓他們以為即使感到不舒服，也必須取悅大人。這絕對不是我們希望他們帶入成年後的觀念。

以下是如何優雅且堅定地處理這些尷尬的節日時刻。

### 1. 提供「打招呼的選項」
在你們抵達 **San Jose** 或 **Fremont** 的派對之前，先練習幾種不同的打招呼方式。
「我們要去見奶奶了。你可以給她一個擁抱、擊掌 (High-five)、碰拳 (Fist bump)，或是揮揮手就好。你自己決定！」

當那一刻來臨時，引導他們：*「叔叔來了！你想跟他擊掌還是揮手？」*
這賦予了孩子權力。他們依然是有禮貌的（有理會對方），但他們掌控了自己的身體空間。

### 2. 當孩子的「保鑣」
你的親戚可能不了解現代的溫和教養。他們可能會覺得受傷。沒關係。你的工作就是負責緩衝。

如果親戚撲過來而你的孩子退縮了，請立刻介入。保持輕鬆愉快的語氣：
*「喔，看來他今天比較想揮手喔！阿姨，來個擊掌吧！」*
你化解了尷尬，肯定了孩子的感受，同時也不會讓親戚覺得被攻擊。

### 3. 不要為他們的界線道歉
我們很容易會說：*「抱歉，他只是害羞。」*
但「害羞」暗示著某種不足。試著改說：*「他現在只是在傾聽自己身體的感覺。」* 或是 *「我們正在練習擁抱前要先問過。」*

當你今天尊重他們的「不」，你就是在教導他們：他們的「不」是重要的。你正在教導他們有權利為自己的身體設立界線——這項技能將保護他們一輩子。

### 自信的禮物
這個節日你能給孩子最好的禮物不是玩具，而是讓他們知道「我的聲音很重要」的那份自信。
