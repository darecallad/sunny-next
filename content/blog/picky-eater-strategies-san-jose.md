"I don't like it! Yucky!"

If you have a toddler, you have heard this. Maybe you spent 30 minutes cooking a healthy dinner, only for them to push the broccoli onto the floor.

In **San Jose**, where we have access to such amazing fresh produce, it can be frustrating when our kids only want to eat beige food (crackers, pasta, nuggets).

At Sunny Child Care, we see picky eating every day. And the number one rule we follow is: **Pressure creates resistance.** The more you force them to eat, the less they will eat.

Here is a simple tool we use to lower the stakes: **The "No Thank You" Bowl.**

### What is a "No Thank You" Bowl?
It is a small, empty bowl placed next to your child's plate.
*   **The Rule:** If there is a food on their plate they don't want to eat, they don't have to eat it. They also don't have to scream or throw it. They simply pick it up and move it to the "No Thank You" Bowl.
*   **The Phrase:** "You don't have to eat it. You can put it in your No Thank You Bowl."

### Why It Works
1.  **It gives them control.** Toddlers crave autonomy. This lets them say "no" in a respectful way.
2.  **It encourages interaction.** To move the broccoli, they have to *touch* it. Touching is the first step to tasting. They might smell it. They might lick their fingers. That is progress!
3.  **It keeps the peace.** It stops the power struggle instantly. The food is off their plate, so they stop panicking.

### The "Safe Food" Strategy
Always serve a new or "scary" food (like asparagus) alongside a "safe" food (like rice or fruit) that you know they love.
This ensures they won't go hungry, which makes them more willing to explore the new item.

### Be a Role Model
Sit down and eat with them. Let them see you enjoying the veggies.
Don't say, *"Eat your carrots, they are good for you."*
Instead, say, *"Mmm, this carrot is so crunchy!"*

Food should be about joy, not negotiation. Give the "No Thank You" Bowl a try tonight, and see if the tension at your table melts away.

「我不喜歡！好噁心！」

如果你有幼兒，你一定聽過這句話。也許你花了 30 分鐘煮了一頓健康的晚餐，結果他們把花椰菜推到地上。

在 **San Jose**，我們擁有這麼棒的新鮮農產品，但當孩子只願意吃「米色食物」（餅乾、義大利麵、雞塊）時，真的很令人挫折。

在 Sunny Child Care，我們每天都看得到挑食的現象。而我們遵循的第一條規則是：**壓力會產生阻力。** 你越強迫他們吃，他們吃得越少。

這裡有一個我們用來降低壓力的簡單工具：**「不謝謝碗 (No Thank You Bowl)」**。

### 什麼是「不謝謝碗」？
這是一個放在孩子盤子旁邊的小空碗。
*   **規則：** 如果盤子裡有他們不想吃的食物，他們不需要吃。他們也不需要尖叫或亂丟。他們只需要把它拿起來，移到「不謝謝碗」裡。
*   **話術：** 「你不需要吃。你可以把它放到不謝謝碗裡。」

### 為什麼這招有效
1.  **給予控制權。** 幼兒渴望自主權。這讓他們可以用尊重的方式說「不」。
2.  **鼓勵互動。** 為了移動花椰菜，他們必須*觸摸*它。觸摸是品嚐的第一步。他們可能會聞到味道。他們可能會舔手指。這就是進步！
3.  **維持和平。** 這能立刻停止權力鬥爭。食物離開了他們的盤子，所以他們不再恐慌。

### 「安全食物」策略
永遠將新食物或「可怕」的食物（像蘆筍）與你確定他們喜歡的「安全」食物（像米飯或水果）一起上桌。
這確保了他們不會餓肚子，這會讓他們更願意探索新食物。

### 以身作則
坐下來跟他們一起吃。讓他們看到你享受蔬菜的樣子。
不要說：*「吃你的紅蘿蔔，這對身體好。」*
試著說：*「嗯～這個紅蘿蔔好脆喔！」*

吃飯應該是關於快樂，而不是談判。今晚試試看「不謝謝碗」，看看餐桌上的緊張氣氛是否會消失。
