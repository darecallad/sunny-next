The suitcases are packed. The tickets are booked. You're ready to fly out of **SJC** or **SFO** to see family. But there is one thing keeping you up at night: *The Flight.*

Will they scream for 5 hours? Will they kick the seat in front of them? Will I be "that parent" getting glares from strangers?

Travel anxiety is real. But as a Director (and a mom who has survived many long-haul flights), I can tell you: Preparation is 90% of the battle.

Here are three "Director-Approved" strategies to turn your flight from a nightmare into a manageable adventure.

### 1. The "Snackle Box" Strategy
For toddlers, eating isn't just for hunger; it's an activity.
Instead of handing them a bag of crackers that they'll finish in 2 minutes, make a "Snackle Box."

Use a tackle box or a bento box with many small compartments. Fill each one with something different: blueberries, cheerios, cheese cubes, a few chocolate chips.
**Why it works:** The act of picking up tiny pieces of food with their pincer grasp takes time and focus. It can buy you 30-45 minutes of quiet time!

### 2. Wrap Your "Entertainment"
Go to the dollar store before your trip and buy a few cheap, new toys (stickers, a small car, a coloring book).
**The Trick:** Wrap them up like holiday gifts.

When the meltdown starts brewing, pull one out. "Look! A special airplane present!"
The unwrapping process is exciting, and the novelty of a new toy holds their attention longer than their old favorites. Space these out—one for every hour of the flight.

### 3. Throw the Rules Out the Window (Temporarily)
At Sunny Child Care, we advocate for routine and limited screen time.
**On an airplane? Forget it.**

If watching *Frozen* three times in a row keeps your child seated and calm, let them do it. If they want to eat fruit snacks for lunch, let them.
Travel is survival mode. You can get back to your healthy routines and strict bedtimes as soon as you land. But at 30,000 feet, your only goal is peace.

### A Note on "Those" Glances
If your child does cry (and they might, because their ears hurt or they are tired), take a deep breath. Ignore the eye rolls from the passenger in 14B. Most people on that plane have been parents or have been children. They understand.

Focus on your child, offer them comfort, and remember: This flight will end. You will get there.

Safe travels to all our **San Jose** families!

行李打包好了，機票訂好了。你準備從 **SJC** 或 **SFO** 機場出發去探親。但有一件事讓你徹夜難眠：*那趟飛行。*

他們會尖叫 5 個小時嗎？他們會踢前面的椅背嗎？我會成為那個被陌生人瞪的「恐龍家長」嗎？

旅行焦慮是真的。但身為園長（也是一位經歷過多次長途飛行的媽媽），我可以告訴你：準備工作佔了勝負的 90%。

這裡有三個「園長認證」的策略，幫你把飛行惡夢變成一場可控的冒險。

### 1. 「零食百寶箱 (Snackle Box)」策略
對幼兒來說，吃東西不只是為了解餓；它是一項活動。
與其給他們一整袋 2 分鐘就吃完的餅乾，不如做一個「零食百寶箱」。

使用有多個小格子的收納盒或便當盒。在每一格放不同的東西：藍莓、麥片圈、起司塊、幾顆巧克力豆。
**為什麼有效：** 用手指捏起細小食物的動作需要時間和專注力。這可以為你爭取到 30-45 分鐘的安靜時間！

### 2. 把「娛樂」包裝起來
出發前去一趟百元商店，買幾個便宜的新玩具（貼紙、小車子、著色本）。
**秘訣是：** 把它們像節日禮物一樣包起來。

當孩子快要崩潰時，拿出一個。「看！飛機上的特別禮物！」
拆禮物的過程很令人興奮，而且新玩具的新鮮感比舊玩具更能吸引他們的注意力。把這些禮物分散開來——每飛行一小時給一個。

### 3. 把規則拋到窗外（暫時地）
在 Sunny Child Care，我們提倡規律作息和限制螢幕時間。
**但在飛機上？忘了吧。**

如果連續看三次《冰雪奇緣》能讓你的孩子乖乖坐著不吵鬧，就讓他們看吧。如果他們午餐想吃水果軟糖，就讓他們吃吧。
旅行是生存模式。一旦落地，你隨時可以恢復健康的飲食和嚴格的睡眠時間。但在三萬英呎的高空，你唯一的目標就是「和平」。

### 關於那些「眼光」
如果你的孩子真的哭了（他們可能會，因為耳朵痛或是累了），深呼吸。忽略 14B 乘客的白眼。飛機上大多數人都當過父母，或是曾經也是個孩子。他們會理解的。

專注在你的孩子身上，安撫他們，並記住：這趟飛行終會結束。你會抵達目的地的。

祝所有 **San Jose** 的家庭旅途平安！
