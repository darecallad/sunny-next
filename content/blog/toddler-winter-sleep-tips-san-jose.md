The days are shorter, the nights are longer, and here in **San Jose**, the temperature is finally dropping. While we don't get snow, our winter nights can get surprisingly chilly (hello, 40 degrees!).

Lately, I've had a few parents ask me: *"Jessie, my toddler was sleeping through the night, but now they're waking up crying at 3 AM. Is it a regression?"*

It might be! But often, it's simply environmental. Winter brings changes in temperature, light, and humidity that can disrupt a sensitive toddler's sleep.

Here are three adjustments we recommend to help your little one hibernate peacefully this season.

### 1. The "Goldilocks" Layering Strategy
It's tempting to bundle them up in fleece pajamas and heavy blankets, but toddlers overheat easily. And when they overheat, they wake up. Conversely, if they kick off their blankets (which they *always* do), they wake up cold.

**The Solution:** Use a "wearable blanket" or sleep sack. It's safer and they can't kick it off.
**Check the Neck:** Don't judge their temperature by their hands or feet (which are usually cooler). Touch their chest or the back of their neck. If it's hot or sweaty, remove a layer. If it's cool, add a onesie underneath.

### 2. Combat the "Heater Cough"
We turn on our heaters to stay warm, but that dry heat is a sleep killer. It dries out nasal passages, leading to stuffy noses, mouth breathing, and that dry, hacking cough that wakes everyone up.

**The Solution:** Run a cool-mist humidifier in their room.
Aim for humidity between 40-60%. This keeps their airways moist and helps ward off those winter viruses we talked about last week. Just remember to clean it regularly!

### 3. Respect the Darker Evenings
In the **Bay Area**, it's pitch black by 5:00 PM now. This lack of sunlight can confuse our internal clocks. You might notice your toddler getting tired earlier than usual.

**The Solution:** Don't fight it.
If they are rubbing their eyes at 6:30 PM, an earlier bedtime might actually prevent them from becoming "overtired" (which, ironically, makes it harder to fall asleep). Try shifting their routine 15-30 minutes earlier during these darkest months.

### Sleep is the Foundation
A well-rested child is a happy child (and a happy parent!). Small tweaks to their environment can make a huge difference in the quality of their sleep.

At Sunny Child Care, we prioritize rest just as much as play. Our nap rooms are designed to be cozy, safe sanctuaries. Come see for yourself!

白天變短了，夜晚變長了，**San Jose** 的氣溫終於開始下降了。雖然我們這裡不下雪，但冬天的夜晚有時候真的蠻冷的（嗨，攝氏 5 度！）。

最近，有幾位家長問我：「Jessie，我的孩子本來都能睡過夜，但現在半夜 3 點都會哭醒。這是睡眠倒退期嗎？」

有可能是！但很多時候，這只是環境因素造成的。冬天的溫度、光線和濕度變化，都很容易打擾敏感幼兒的睡眠。

以下是我們建議的三個調整方法，幫助你的小寶貝在這個季節能像冬眠一樣睡得香甜。

### 1. 「剛剛好」的洋蔥式穿法
我們很容易想把孩子包得像粽子一樣，穿上刷毛睡衣再蓋厚被子，但幼兒其實很容易過熱。一旦過熱，他們就會醒來。相反地，如果他們踢被子（他們*總是*會踢被子），又會被冷醒。

**解決方案：** 使用「防踢被」或睡袋。這比較安全，而且他們踢不掉。
**檢查頸部：** 不要摸手腳來判斷冷熱（手腳通常比較涼）。摸摸他們的胸口或後頸。如果是熱的或有流汗，就減少一件衣服。如果是涼的，就在裡面多加一件包屁衣。

### 2. 對抗「暖氣咳」
我們開暖氣是為了保暖，但乾燥的熱風是睡眠殺手。它會讓鼻腔乾燥，導致鼻塞、用嘴巴呼吸，還有那種會把全家吵醒的乾咳。

**解決方案：** 在房間開一台冷霧加濕器。
將濕度保持在 40-60% 之間。這能保持呼吸道濕潤，也有助於抵擋我們上週提到的冬季病毒。只要記得定期清洗加濕器就好！

### 3. 順應黑夜的節奏
現在在 **Bay Area**，下午 5 點就已經全黑了。缺乏陽光會混淆我們的生理時鐘。你可能會發現孩子比平常更早覺得累。

**解決方案：** 不要對抗它。
如果他們在晚上 6:30 就開始揉眼睛，提早一點上床睡覺其實可以避免他們變得「過度疲累」（過累反而會讓孩子更難入睡，很諷刺吧）。在這個最黑暗的月份裡，試著將作息提早 15-30 分鐘。

### 睡眠是成長的基石
睡飽的孩子就是快樂的孩子（也是快樂的父母！）。對環境做一點小小的調整，就能大大提升他們的睡眠品質。

在 Sunny Child Care，我們重視休息，就像重視遊戲一樣。我們的午睡室設計得既舒適又安全。歡迎親自來參觀！
