We all have that picture-perfect image in our heads: You are sitting in a rocking chair, your toddler is nestled quietly in your lap, and you are reading a story from start to finish.

The reality? You read two sentences, your toddler flips 10 pages forward, tries to eat the book corner, and then runs off to find a truck.

Many parents in **San Jose** tell me, *"My child just doesn't like reading. They won't sit still."*

I have good news: **That is completely normal.** Toddlers are active learners. They don't learn by sitting still; they learn by moving. Here is how to keep reading fun, even for the wiggliest toddlers.

### 1. You Don't Have to Read Every Word
There is no rule that says you must read the text exactly as written.
*   **The Strategy:** If they flip the page before you finish, go with it!
*   **Picture Walk:** Instead of reading, just talk about the pictures. *"Look! A big red dog! He is running fast!"*
*   **Why:** The goal is **engagement**, not completion. If you force them to stay on a page, reading becomes a chore.

### 2. Make It a Performance
Toddlers love drama. If you read in a monotone voice, they will tune out.
*   **The Strategy:** Use funny voices. Make loud animal sounds. Use your hands.
*   **The Hook:** *"The bear went GRRRRR!"* (Tickle their tummy).
*   **Why:** You are competing with toys and screens. You need to be the most interesting thing in the room.

### 3. Let Them Be the Boss (Visit the Library!)
We are lucky to have the amazing **San Jose Public Library** system.
*   **The Strategy:** Take them to the library and let *them* pull books off the shelf.
*   **The Rule:** Even if they pick a book about garbage trucks for the 100th time, check it out.
*   **Why:** When they choose the book, they are more invested in opening it.

### It's About Connection, Not Curriculum
At this age, reading is not about teaching them to read. It's about teaching them to **love books**.
If you only read for 3 minutes, but it was 3 minutes of giggling and pointing, that is a success.

At Sunny Child Care, our reading corners are designed for exploration. We want books to feel like toys—accessible, fun, and part of everyday play.

<!-- zh-start -->

我們腦海中都有那個完美的畫面：你坐在搖椅上，幼兒安靜地窩在你懷裡，你從頭到尾讀完一個故事。

現實呢？你讀了兩句，你的幼兒往後翻了 10 頁，試著咬書角，然後跑去玩卡車。

許多 **San Jose** 的家長告訴我：*「我的孩子就是不喜歡看書。他們坐不住。」*

我有個好消息：**這完全正常。** 幼兒是動態的學習者。他們不是靠坐著不動來學習，而是靠移動來學習。以下是如何讓閱讀變得有趣，即使是對最好動的幼兒。

### 1. 你不需要讀每一個字
沒有規定說你必須照著字面讀。
*   **策略：** 如果你還沒讀完他們就翻頁，就跟著翻！
*   **看圖說話：** 不要讀文字，直接聊圖片。*「你看！一隻紅色的大狗！他跑得好快！」*
*   **原因：** 目標是**參與**，而不是讀完。如果你強迫他們停在某一頁，閱讀就會變成苦差事。

### 2. 把讀書變成一場表演
幼兒喜歡戲劇效果。如果你用單調的聲音讀，他們會放空。
*   **策略：** 用好笑的聲音。發出大聲的動物叫聲。用你的雙手比劃。
*   **鉤子：** *「大熊發出 吼～～的聲音！」*（搔他們的肚子）。
*   **原因：** 你正在跟玩具和螢幕競爭。你必須成為房間裡最有趣的東西。

### 3. 讓他們當老闆（去圖書館！）
我們很幸運擁有很棒的 **San Jose Public Library** 系統。
*   **策略：** 帶他們去圖書館，讓*他們*自己從架上拿書。
*   **規則：** 即使他們第 100 次選了關於垃圾車的書，也借回家。
*   **原因：** 當書是他們選的，他們會更有興趣打開它。

### 重點是連結，不是課程
在這個年紀，閱讀不是為了教他們識字。而是為了教他們**愛上書本**。
如果你只讀了 3 分鐘，但那是充滿咯咯笑聲和指指點點的 3 分鐘，那就是成功。

在 Sunny Child Care，我們的閱讀角是為了探索而設計的。我們希望書本感覺像玩具一樣——隨手可得、有趣，並且是日常遊戲的一部分。
